        Hello there! I am a recent graduate from UNCCs' full stack development bootcamp and this is a little taste of what I can do. Some of the technologies I have learned include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, React, GitHub, Insomnia and many more. Fell free to check out my GitHub to see some of my projects. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out on my contact page.
